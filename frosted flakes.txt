<p><b>Frosted Flakes</b> or <b>Frosties</b> is a breakfast cereal, produced by the Kellogg Company and consisting of sugar-coated corn flakes. It was introduced in the United States in 1952, as <b>Sugar Frosted Flakes</b>. The word "sugar" was dropped from the name in 1983.</p>
<p>Generic versions, such as store brands, are also available. Unlike many cereals (Cheerios and Rice Krispies, for example), Frosted Flakes shares its name with generic competitors.</p>

<p>Tony the Tiger has been the mascot of Frosted Flakes since its introduction. Tony is known for uttering the cereal's slogan: "They're Gr-r-reat!" (the "r"s in "Great" being drawn-out). Tony the Tiger was originally voiced by Dallas McKennon, but Thurl Ravenscroft voiced him for more than 50 years, until his death in 2005. Tony was later voiced (in Canada and the US) by former professional wrestling play-by-play announcer Lee Marshall until his passing on April 27, 2014. After Marshall's death, he was replaced with Tex Brashear. Van Horne also voiced Tony in a 1997 television commercial. In the UK, Tom Hill voiced Tony after Ravenscroft's death. Tony is drawn wearing a red bandana on all Frosted Flakes cereal boxes.</p>
